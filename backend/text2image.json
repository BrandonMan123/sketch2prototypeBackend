    "0" : "Create a sketch of a countertop-mounted, electronically powered jet turbine with a clear air intake at one end and internal components, including a small AC motor, visibly integrated into the design",
    "1" : "Create a simple line drawing of a cylindrical container labeled \"milk\" with a hose connected to it leading to a rectangular device labeled \"micro bubble injector.\"",
    "2" : "A sketch of a mechanical device designed to shake a cup: The device features a rectangular box with an open front where a cup is placed. Two prongs extend towards each other from opposing sides of the box, positioned to hold the cup in place. On one side of the prongs, a double-ended arrow indicates a vigorous up and down motion designed to shake the cup. The cup is double-closed with an undisclosed liquid inside, presumably milk. The mechanism is implied to operate with some form of motor to create the shaking motion",
    "3" : "A rudimentary sketch of a mechanical device with a rectangular base and a vibrating platform above it, indicated by wavy lines, on which a cup, depicted as a cylindrical object with a smaller upper rectangle to represent its opening, is placed. The sketch also shows an arrow pointing downwards towards the cup from the vibrating platform, suggesting the direction of the movement. The device appears to be designed to shake the cup vigorously",
    "4" : "Create a simple line drawing of a mechanical bull riding machine. On the machine, directly above the bull's body, illustrate a box with a stick figure inside, representing a rider. Add a horizontal line connected to the box, suggesting motion to indicate the rider is being shaken. Draw curved lines around the figure for added movement effect. Above the machine, inscribe the word \"RODEO\" in capital letters"
